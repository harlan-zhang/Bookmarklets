There is a way to increase any HTML5 playback speed.

Youtube allows you to do this up to 2x.
I am not sure what is maximum is, you can change it yourself.

From practice I find that you have to 'accelerate' your speed - start with 1.5, then 2, then 2.5.

Also, some browsers can exhibit odd sound clipping behaviour.

Sets playback speed to 2.5X:
<pre> javascript:(function(){document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0].playbackRate = 2.5})(); </pre>


Sets playback speed to 3X:
<pre> javascript:(function(){document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0].playbackRate = 3.0})();</pre>
